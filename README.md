# Elite_2Deep

## Setup
Install Python 3.6.
Use pip to install the modules pygame and numpy.
There is also a requirements.txt with the pip freeze, which might work if you want to use that (not tested).
The game has been tested in python on Windows 10, but should also work on other operating systems.

## Gameplay
This is a local multiplayer 2D space shooter game.
The spaceship movement is (almost) Newtonian, except that there is a maximum translational and a maximum rotational velocity.
This means aiming is difficult. I have included some alternative ship movement schemes which can be accessed through the diffculty submenu.

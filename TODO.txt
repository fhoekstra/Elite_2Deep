easy:
x fullscreen
x >rebind controls in menu

sound:
x > firing
x >> separate sounds for different weapons
x >> charging
> thrusters

visual:
// renderer object // no need
x >< object draw with world coords < nope, leave in utils functions for now
X >UI element draw with normalized screen coords 
X >stars background
X >> stars as circles with world coordinate defined radius
X > main menu
X > weapon select
X > weapon UI element displacement -> fix bug with no ammo rails always top left
X > ship select
X > render controls from source -> add more keys to names dict
X > hit markers
> use sprite for projectiles to increase performance
> thruster vfx

structural:
> player objects
> joysticks
>> only activate control schemes for players who confirm presence at start
> use decorators to get less if statements

gameplay:
x HP + lasers
x clip and reload for railgun
x heat
x ship-ship collisions
x scenarios, reset
x use max elasticity constant of objects for both in collision
x some form of maximum distance
x rockets (kinetic)

x simple pulse laser
x weapon impacts mass and L
// mass and thrusters determine vmax // no need
 bombs
 (ram) booster pack or armour
